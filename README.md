# What do we want here

We want a linear Icinga Installation guide.

Ideally there would be a OS selector in the beginning.
Maybe start with an Ubuntu and then go on from there.

**Installed should be:**
- Icinga 2
- Icinga Web 2
- IcingaDB
- Director (maybe?)

It should be one Single Node environment that monitors itself.

Maybe in the end there could be further topics, that can be linked.
Like link to the docs of "How to add a check" and the like.

# What do we have so far?

This is what we have at the moment:
https://icinga.com/get-started/#installation-course

# Resources

We are using mkdocs: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/
Only use free version features.

Ask Blerim, when you are ready to generate the docs locally.

You can reference the IcingaDB docs: https://github.com/Icinga/icingadb/tree/main/doc
